## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "Gemini API key required" Error

**Problem:** You haven't entered an API key or it's invalid.

**Solution:**
- Make sure you've entered your Gemini API key

- Make sure the file extension is correct

#### 3. "File too large" Error

**Problem:** Your PDF exceeds the 10MB limit.

**Solution:**
- Compress your PDF using online tools
- Reduce the resolution of scanned images
- Split large PDFs into smaller files

#### 4. "Empty file" Error

**Problem:** The uploaded file is empty or corrupted.

**Solution:**
- Re-download the original PDF
- Check if the file opens in a PDF viewer
- Try a different PDF file

#### 5. All Allergens Show as "Present"

**Problem:** Incorrect extraction results.

**Causes:**
- PDF format is unusual or unclear
- Text is not properly structured
- OCR failed for scanned documents

**Solutions:**
- Try with a different PDF format
- Ensure the document is clear and readable
- Check if nutrition table is clearly visible
- Use a real PDF instead of a scanned one

#### 6. Nutrients Show "N/A"

**Problem:** Nutritional values couldn't be extracted.

**Causes:**
- Nutritional information is in an unusual format
- OCR errors in scanned documents
- Table structure is not recognized

**Solutions:**
- Ensure nutrition table is clearly visible

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is my API key secure?**  
A: Yes! Your API key is stored locally in your browser and never sent to our servers. Only Google receives your API key for processing.

**Q: Can I use this offline?**  
A: No, the application requires internet connection to access the Google Gemini API.

**Q: Is there a limit on how many PDFs I can process?**  
A: The limit depends on your Google Gemini API quota. Free tier includes generous usage limits.

**Q: Do you store my PDFs?**  
A: No! PDFs are processed in memory and never stored on any server. Everything is processed and discarded immediately.

**Q: Is this service free?**  
A: The application is free to use, but Google Gemini API has usage limits. Check Google AI Studio for current pricing.

**Q: Which browsers are supported?**  
A: All modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

### Data Accuracy Questions

**Q: How accurate is the extraction?**  
A: Accuracy depends on PDF quality and format. Typically 90-95% for well-structured documents. Always verify critical data.

**Q: Can I trust the extracted allergen information?**  
A: While the AI is highly accurate, always verify allergen information for safety-critical applications. This tool is a time-saver, not a replacement for human review for critical safety data.

**Q: What happens if the PDF has multiple languages?**  
A: The system supports multiple languages including English, Hungarian, French, and Spanish. It will automatically detect and extract data.

**Q: Can it read handwriting in PDFs?**  
A: No, the system is designed for printed or typed text. Handwritten text may not be accurately extracted.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What file formats are supported?**  
A: Only PDF files are currently supported (`.pdf` extension).

**Q: What's the maximum file size?**  
A: 10MB is the current maximum file size.

**Q: How long does processing take?**  
A: Typically 2-5 seconds for real PDFs, 5-10 seconds for scanned documents.

**Q: What happens if I upload a scanned document?**  
A: The system uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from images. This takes slightly longer but works well for clear scanned documents.

**Q: Can I process multiple PDFs at once?**  
A: Currently, you can process one PDF at a time. For multiple files, process them one by one.

**Q: Where can I find the API documentation?**  
A: API documentation is available at `/docs` endpoint when the backend is running (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/docs`).

### Export and Integration Questions

**Q: Can I export results to Excel?**  
A: Currently, only JSON export is available. You can convert JSON to Excel using online tools or Excel's data import feature.

**Q: Can I integrate this into my own application?**  
A: Yes! Use the API endpoints. Documentation is in the Developer Guide.

**Q: Can I run this on my own server?**  
A: Yes, see the deployment documentation for self-hosting instructions.

## Tips for Best Results

### PDF Quality Tips

1. **Use original PDFs when possible** - Not scanned copies
2. **Ensure clear nutrition tables** - Well-formatted tables extract better
3. **Good scan quality** - If using scanned PDFs, use at least 300 DPI
4. **Avoid handwritten notes** - Printed text extracts more accurately
5. **Proper orientation** - Make sure the PDF is not rotated or upside-down

### Data Extraction Tips

1. **Verify critical data** - Always double-check allergen information for safety
2. **Check units** - Make sure units (g, kg, ml) are correctly extracted
3. **Review N/A values** - If many values are N/A, the document format might not be supported
4. **Export results** - Save your results using the export feature

### Performance Tips

1. **Optimize PDFs** - Smaller files process faster
2. **Good internet** - Faster connection means faster processing
3. **Clear browser cache** - If having issues, clear cache and try again
